# A Gemfile is a ruby file that uses bundler syntax to declare what
# gems are needed for a project.

# when you run 'bundle install', bundler looks for Gemfile and then
# starts installing gems


# most common place to host gems is rubygems.org
source 'http://rubygems.org'

gem "maruku"
# for this gem the install name is different from require name
gem "aws-s3", :require => "aws/s3"



####### Can also use bundler to require gems #####
=begin
  For instance,

  require 'bundler/setup'
  Bundler.require(:default)

  is equivalent to requiring all the gems listed, e.g.
  require 'maruku'
  require 'aws/s3'
=end

###Note: the Gemfile.lock (the .lock file) is auto-generated by bundler.
